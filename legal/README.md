#### Computer Misuse Act 2000

With the rise of personal computing devices in the 1980s and their increased prominence in businesses, lawmakers drafted fresh rules that aimed to protect the information increasingly on these machines.

The Computer Misuse Act (CMA) 1990 is a key piece of legislation that criminalises the act of accessing or modifying data stored on a computer system without appropriate consent or permission. 
It was devised after the Regina v Gold and Schifreen case of 1987, in which two hackers remotely accessed BT’s Prestel service at a trade show using the credentials of a BT engineer.
The two defendants, Robert Schifreen and Stephen Gold used a technique known as shoulder surfing to ascertain these credentials, and eventually hunted down the email account of the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, once they had infiltrated the Prestel system.

BT had noticed odd behaviour on the account they were using, and began monitoring this activity, before passing their intelligence to the police.
They were convicted under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, but this was overturned on appeal based on the fact they hadn't tried to profit from their activity.

It became abundantly clear in light of this whole affair that the expanding digital landscape demanded additional legislation to better help law enforcement keep digitally-accessible information safe and secure.
Since its introduction, the CMA 1990 has been updated several times to reflect continuous changes to the cyber landscape.

##### Criminal offenses under The Computer Misuse Act 1990
[source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/computer-misuse-act)
- Unauthorized access to computers, including the illicit copying of software held in any computer. This carries a penalty of up to six months’ imprisonment or up to a £5000 fine and will be dealt with by a magistrate. This covers hobby hacking and, potentially, penetration testing.
- Unauthorized access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offenses (such as fraud or theft), which covers more serious cases of hacking with a criminal intent. This has a penalty of up to five years’ imprisonment and an unlimited fine. Because it is a serious offense, it will be a trial by jury (12 jolly good people).
- Unauthorized modification of computer material, which includes the intentional and unauthorized destruction of software or data; the circulation of “infected” materials online (“viruses”); and the unauthorized addition of a password to a data file (“crypto viruses”). This offense also carries a penalty of up to five years’ imprisonment and an unlimited fine. It is also a serious offense, so it too will be a trial by jury.

#### Data Protection Act 1998

The Data Protection Act 1998 defines 8 key principles as outlined by Wikipedia (January 2017):

- Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.
- Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed.
- Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
- Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.
